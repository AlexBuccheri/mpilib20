# mpilib20

This library provides both free subroutine and object-orientated bindings to MPI fortran, whilst maintaining standard MPI naming conventions as far as 
possible and avoiding the use of non-standard preprocessing. 
The plan is to support both CMake and Meson build systems, and incorporate a unit testing framework.
